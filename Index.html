    <h1 align-center>Welcome to the first page</h1>
    <p>Currently dog's habitats are human homes and yards. 
        This can range from apartments to ranches and farms, anywhere that a human lives. 
        A dog's diet consists of scraps they find, animals they may catch, and mainly processed food given to them by their owners.
        There are approximately 900 million dogs across the globe, either being kept as pets, living in wild packs, or fending for themselves as strays. 
        Learning more about dogs can help us make educated choices when it comes to how we acquire our pets and the care that we give them.</p>
